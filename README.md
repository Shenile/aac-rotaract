# **Rotaract Club of Arul Anandar College - Student Data Management System**

## **Vision**
The Rotaract Club of Arul Anandar College envisions itself as a unit of an International Youth Organisation that supports and promotes youth to play a vital role in the development of society.

## **Mission**
Our mission is to encourage our members to become responsible citizens and competent leaders in the future.

## **Objectives**
- Familiarize students with the Vision and Mission of the Rotaract Club.
- Understand the role of youth in transforming society.
- Promote awareness of the social responsibility of youth.
- Enable students to become responsible citizens.
- Help students explore their role as global citizens.

The Rotaract Club of Arul Anandar College has conducted various programs vital to nation-building. We have organized orientation programs in collaboration with the Rotary Club of Madurai North West, and awareness programs on social issues like womenâ€™s participation in politics, transgender rights, and more. These programs have made a significant impact in the community.

## **Project Overview**
This project, **Rotaract Club Student Data Management System**, was developed to manage the data of club members and events efficiently. Previously, the club had to manually write and maintain records, which was time-consuming and prone to errors. This system modernizes the process, providing a web-based solution for seamless data management.

## **Core Features**
1. **Student Data Management**  
   - Manage student data efficiently and securely.
   - Features like adding, updating, and deleting student records.
   - Option to upload student data in Excel format for easy importation and processing.

2. **Filter Options**  
   - Search and filter data based on specific criteria (e.g., student name, course, etc.).

3. **PDF Generation**  
   - Generate reports of student data and events in a well-formatted PDF document.

4. **Admin Features**  
   - Admin panel to manage student data, view reports, and perform data updates.
   - Admin can delete all records if necessary.

5. **Student Features**  
   - Students can log in and manage their profiles (view, update personal data).
   - Modern, responsive design tailored for both mobile and desktop versions.
   - Easy navigation and user-friendly interface.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** React.js with Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Database:** MySQL
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy
- **PDF Generation:** reportlab
- **Excel File Processing:** `openpyxl` or similar library for Excel file imports

## **Installation and Setup**

### 1. **Frontend Setup (React with Vite)**
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository_url>
     cd <project_folder>
     ```
   - Install frontend dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Run the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (default port for Vite).

### 2. **Backend Setup (FastAPI)**
   - Clone the backend repository (if it's in a separate folder):
     ```bash
     git clone <backend_repository_url>
     cd <backend_folder>
     ```
   - Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Install backend dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Run the FastAPI server:
     ```bash
     uvicorn main:app --reload
     ```

   - The FastAPI server should now be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. **MySQL Database Setup**
   - Make sure you have MySQL installed and running.
   - Create a new database for the project:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE rotaract_db;
     ```
   - Set up the database tables using SQLAlchemy ORM (refer to backend documentation for table setup and migrations).

### 4. **Connecting Frontend and Backend**
   - Make sure your frontend (React) is configured to make requests to the backend (FastAPI). Update the API base URL in your frontend configuration if necessary.

### 5. **Running the Full Application**
   - After setting up the frontend, backend, and database, ensure both servers (Vite and FastAPI) are running concurrently:
     - Vite frontend at `http://localhost:5173`
     - FastAPI backend at `http://localhost:8000`

## **Usage**
- **Admin Login:** Admin can log in using the designated credentials and manage all aspects of the system, including student data and events.
- **Student Login:** Students can log in to manage their personal profile information and view events or announcements.

## **PDF Generation**
- The system provides functionality to generate formatted PDFs for student data and event reports.
- Admin can download and view student records and reports in PDF format.

## **Excel File Upload**
- Students or Admin can upload an Excel file to add multiple records at once.
- The system will process the data and update the database accordingly.
